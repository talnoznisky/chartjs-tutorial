working on this tutorial:
http://tobiasahlin.com/blog/introduction-to-chartjs/

1. insert most current chartjs bundle. in this case, 2.7.3. the tutorial is a little out of date.
2. insert canvas tag - canvas tag is an element that uses js to draw into a bitmap
3. add the data in script js file. charts requires array data types. for line or bar charts, make one array for labels, then create one array for each set of data. make sure they are all the same length.
4. then you create little json pieces in data and dataset objects to tell the Chart what data to use and how to style it.

I changed the styling and swapped line graph to a clustered bar chart just to experiment.
